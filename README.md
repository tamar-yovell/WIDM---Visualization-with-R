# WIDM---Visualization-with-R
 Using data about the Dutch TV show Wie is de Mol to practice visualization with R and ggplot

Goal: Create 5+ plots based on data about the Dutch TV show Wie is de Mol. 
Learn to visualize in R. Data scraping.

Data collection: Mostly manually, using Wikipedia and wiewasdemol.nl. For the 4th plot the data was gained with rvest (html scraping library).
The data is about all seasons before the 2020 anniversary season (20 seasons in total).

Tools used: Excel for data collecting and cleaning. R and ggplot to compute aggregate values and create the plots.

Results:
1. Pie chart - gender
2. Season number vs. Mole occupation. This plot shows the sudden development of the show from (previously) unknown candidates to more famous personalities.
3. Continents - Count how often the show visits different continents.
4. Ratings - How many people watched the final episode of each season?
