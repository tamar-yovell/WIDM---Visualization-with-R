# WIDM---Visualization-with-R
 Using data about the Dutch TV show Wie is de Mol to practice visualization with R and ggplot

Goal: Create 5+ plots based on data about the Dutch TV show Wie is de Mol. 

Data collection: Mostly manually, using Wikipedia and wiewasdemol.nl. The data is about all seasons before the 2020 anniversary season (20 seasons in total).

Tools used: Excel for data collecting and cleaning. R and ggplot to compute aggregate values and create the plots.

Results:
1. Pie chart - gender
2. Season number vs. Mole occupation. This plot shows the sudden development of the show from (previously) unknown candidates to more famous personalities.
